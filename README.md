## NFT Website Concept
This repository contains an HTML file that displays the conceptual look of a modern landing page for an NFT business. This project was developed using HTML and SCSS.

## Installation
This HTML file does not need Yarn or NPM to install the application. Simply open the HTML file to use it. If you would like to fork the design, make sure you have a SASS Compiler installed in your Microsoft Visual Studio Code app to convert the SCSS file to CSS. Without the compiler, the SCSS version would not render any stylish changes to the HTML file.

## Project Status
The project runs as expected.The HTML file doesn't display the view, thus, you will need to view the front-end version in the link provided below. This project doesn't render properly on mobile phones because I didn't have enough time to implement RWD strategies.

## Live Version
To view the live version of the code without downloading the HTML file, please click on the CodePen link (https://codepen.io/E-Benny/pen/dyKqpJK).
